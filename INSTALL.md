# Installation Instructions for Project Setup

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that the following tools and software versions are installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.0 or higher. [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: Download and install the latest version from the [MongoDB Official Website](https://www.mongodb.com/).
- **React**: Version 18.0 or higher.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
## Step 2: Backend Setup
## Step 3: Frontend Setup
## Step 4: Launch the Application
Clone the project repository to your local machine by running:
```bash
git clone <repository-link>

Replace <repository-link> with the actual repository URL.


Open a terminal window and navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend
Install the required backend packages:
npm install
Start the backend service:
npm start

In a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory:
cd frontend

Install the required frontend packages:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm run dev

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the application.

The project should now be up and running successfully.

Tips:
Environment Variables: Ensure any necessary environment variables are configured, particularly for database connections. Create a .env file in both backend and frontend directories if required, following the example .env.example file.
Database Setup: Start your MongoDB instance if itâ€™s not running by default. For local databases, use mongod in a terminal window to initialize.
Testing: If the project includes testing, run tests by using npm test in either the frontend or backend directory after completing the installation steps.

For further assistance, refer to the project documentation or reach out to the contributors.
